Web development project for university. 
The goal was to create a site that would give information about a book, in this case I chose The Steadfast Tin Soldier.
In particular the site is fully written in Romanian language and requires users to register or log in before interacting with anything.

Written with PHP, MySQL and JS (bit of JQuery), ran using XAMPP/phpMyAdmin.

Branches 1-6 show the progress stages until the final product is done.
